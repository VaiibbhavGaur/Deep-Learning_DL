## Concepts  
Deep learning, which is a specialized and advanced form of machine learning, performs what is considered “end-to-end learning”. A deep learning algorithm is given massive volumes of data, typically unstructured and disparate, and a task to perform such as classification. The resulting model is then capable of solving such complex tasks such as recognizing objects within an image and translating speech in real time.
